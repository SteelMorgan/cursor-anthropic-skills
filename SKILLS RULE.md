# CRITICAL SKILLS RULE

**ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY BEFORE ANY RESPONSE **

**STEP 1: ALWAYS READ SKILLS INDEX**
- **MUST** read `D:\My Projects\FrameWork Global\LLM Skills\Skills index.md` FIRST
- **MUST** analyze request for keywords AND semantic meaning
- **MUST** identify relevant skills

**STEP 2: APPLY SKILLS**
- **MUST** study corresponding skill file if ANY match found
- **MUST** apply knowledge from skill in response
- **MUST** mention which skill was used and why

**STEP 3: VERIFICATION**
- **MUST** show evidence of skill application
- **MUST** use correct syntax/commands from skill rules
- **MUST** reference skill file in response

**CRITICAL KEYWORDS TO DETECT:**
- `powershell`, `ps1`, `script`, `windows`, `cmd`, `bat` → POWERSHELL_RULES.md
- `html`, `react`, `webapp`, `ui` → artifacts-builder/SKILL.md
- `playwright`, `automation`, `browser` → playwright-docker-automation/SKILL.md
- `document`, `docx`, `pdf`, `xlsx` → document skills
- `test`, `testing` → webapp-testing/SKILL.md

**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS EXAMPLES:**
- "Create a script" → PowerShell skills
- "Build a website" → Web development skills  
- "Test my app" → Testing skills
- "Generate a document" → Document skills
- "Automate browser" → Playwright skills

**VIOLATION = CRITICAL ERROR - AGENT WILL BE REPRIMANDED **

**EXAMPLE OF CORRECT RESPONSE:**
"I read Skills index.md and detected PowerShell keywords. I studied POWERSHELL_RULES.md and applied the following rules: [list rules used]. Here's the script using proper PowerShell syntax..."
