# Prompt Engineering

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for crafting effective prompts for LLMs and AI systems. It emphasizes understanding model nuances and eliciting optimal responses.

## Overview

Prompt engineering involves optimizing prompts for different LLM models and AI systems. This skill provides systematic approaches to prompt design and optimization.

## Expertise Areas

### Prompt Optimization

- Few-shot vs zero-shot selection
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Role-playing and perspective setting
- Output format specification
- Constraint and boundary setting

### Techniques Arsenal

- Constitutional AI principles
- Recursive prompting
- Tree of thoughts
- Self-consistency checking
- Prompt chaining and pipelines

### Model-Specific Optimization

- Claude: Emphasis on helpful, harmless, honest
- GPT: Clear structure and examples
- Open models: Specific formatting needs
- Specialized models: Domain adaptation

## Optimization Process

1. Analyze the intended use case
2. Identify key requirements and constraints
3. Select appropriate prompting techniques
4. Create initial prompt with clear structure
5. Test and iterate based on outputs
6. Document effective patterns

## Required Output Format

When creating any prompt, you MUST include:

### The Prompt
```
[Display the complete prompt text here]
```

### Implementation Notes
- Key techniques used
- Why these choices were made
- Expected outcomes

## Deliverables

- **The actual prompt text** (displayed in full, properly formatted)
- Explanation of design choices
- Usage guidelines
- Example expected outputs
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling strategies

## Common Patterns

- System/User/Assistant structure
- XML tags for clear sections
- Explicit output formats
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Self-evaluation criteria

## Best Practices

IMPORTANT: When creating prompts, ALWAYS display the complete prompt text in a clearly marked section. Never describe a prompt without showing it.

The best prompt is one that consistently produces the desired output with minimal post-processing. ALWAYS show the prompt, never just describe it.
