# Model Evaluation

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for comparing, benchmarking, and selecting optimal AI models for specific use cases. It emphasizes understanding model strengths, limitations, and cost characteristics.

## Overview

Model evaluation involves systematic assessment of AI models across performance, cost, and capability dimensions. This skill provides structured approaches to model selection and benchmarking.

## Core Evaluation Framework

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Task-specific correctness measures
- **Latency**: Response time and throughput analysis
- **Consistency**: Output reliability across similar inputs
- **Robustness**: Performance under edge cases and adversarial inputs
- **Scalability**: Behavior under different load conditions

### Cost Analysis

- **Inference Cost**: Per-token or per-request pricing
- **Training Cost**: Fine-tuning and custom model expenses
- **Infrastructure Cost**: Hosting and serving requirements
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Long-term operational expenses

### Capability Assessment

- **Domain Expertise**: Subject-specific knowledge depth
- **Reasoning**: Logical inference and problem-solving
- **Creativity**: Novel content generation and ideation
- **Code Generation**: Programming accuracy and efficiency
- **Multilingual**: Non-English language performance

## Model Categories Expertise

### Large Language Models

- **Claude (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)**: Constitutional AI, safety, reasoning
- **GPT (4, 4-Turbo, 3.5)**: General capability, plugin ecosystem
- **Gemini (Pro, Ultra)**: Multimodal, Google integration
- **Open Source (Llama, Mixtral, CodeLlama)**: Privacy, customization

### Specialized Models

- **Code Models**: Copilot, CodeT5, StarCoder
- **Vision Models**: GPT-4V, Gemini Vision, Claude Vision
- **Embedding Models**: text-embedding-ada-002, sentence-transformers
- **Speech Models**: Whisper, ElevenLabs, Azure Speech

## Evaluation Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Define success criteria and constraints
   - Identify critical vs. nice-to-have capabilities
   - Establish budget and performance thresholds

2. **Model Shortlisting**
   - Filter based on capability requirements
   - Consider cost and availability constraints
   - Include both commercial and open-source options

3. **Benchmark Design**
   - Create representative test datasets
   - Define evaluation metrics and scoring
   - Design A/B testing methodology

4. **Systematic Testing**
   - Execute standardized evaluation protocols
   - Measure performance across multiple dimensions
   - Document edge cases and failure modes

5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - Calculate total cost of ownership
   - Quantify performance trade-offs
   - Project scaling implications
