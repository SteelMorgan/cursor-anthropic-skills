# Frontend Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for modern React applications and responsive design. It emphasizes component-first thinking and performance optimization.

## Overview

Frontend development involves creating React components, managing state, optimizing performance, and ensuring accessibility. This skill provides systematic approaches to frontend architecture.

## Focus Areas

- React component architecture (hooks, context, performance)
- Responsive CSS with Tailwind/CSS-in-JS
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- Frontend performance (lazy loading, code splitting, memoization)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Approach

1. Component-first thinking - reusable, composable UI pieces
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. Performance budgets - aim for sub-3s load times
4. Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
5. Type safety with TypeScript when applicable

## Output Format

Provide:
- Complete React component with props interface
- Styling solution (Tailwind classes or styled-components)
- State management implementation if needed
- Basic unit test structure
- Accessibility checklist for the component
- Performance considerations and optimizations

## Best Practices

Focus on working code over explanations. Include usage examples in comments.
