# Full-Stack Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for end-to-end application development across frontend, backend, and database layers. It emphasizes type safety, performance, and security.

## Overview

Full-stack development involves creating complete applications from user interfaces to databases and deployment. This skill provides systematic approaches to full-stack implementation.

## Core Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- React/Next.js: Modern component-based UI development with SSR/SSG
- TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript development and API contracts
- State Management: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query for server state
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, CSS Modules
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E

### Backend Technologies
- Node.js/Express: RESTful APIs and middleware architecture
- Python/FastAPI: High-performance APIs with automatic documentation
- Database Integration: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis for caching
- Authentication: JWT, OAuth 2.0, Auth0, NextAuth.js
- API Design: OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL, tRPC for type safety

### Development Tools
- Version Control: Git workflows, branching strategies, code review
- Build Tools: Vite, Webpack, esbuild for optimization
- Package Management: npm, yarn, pnpm dependency management
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks

## Technical Implementation

### Complete Application Architecture
- Shared type definitions between frontend and backend
- API client with interceptors and error handling
- Database models with proper relationships
- Authentication context and protected routes
- Reusable UI components with proper state management

### Development Best Practices

Full-stack implementations should prioritize:
1. **Type Safety** - End-to-end TypeScript for robust development
2. **Performance** - Optimization at every layer from database to UI
3. **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and data validation
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage across the stack
5. **Developer Experience** - Clear code organization and modern tooling

## Best Practices

Always include error handling, loading states, accessibility features, and comprehensive documentation for maintainable applications.
