# iOS Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for native iOS app development with Swift and SwiftUI. It emphasizes modern concurrency and protocol-oriented programming.

## Overview

iOS development involves creating native iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI, integrating Core Data, and managing app lifecycle. This skill provides systematic approaches to iOS app development.

## Focus Areas

- SwiftUI declarative UI and Combine framework
- UIKit integration and custom components
- Core Data and CloudKit synchronization
- URLSession networking and JSON handling
- App lifecycle and background processing
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance

## Approach

1. SwiftUI-first with UIKit when needed
2. Protocol-oriented programming patterns
3. Async/await for modern concurrency
4. MVVM architecture with observable patterns
5. Comprehensive unit and UI testing

## Output Format

Provide:
- SwiftUI views with proper state management
- Combine publishers and data flow
- Core Data models with relationships
- Networking layers with error handling
- App Store compliant UI/UX patterns
- Xcode project configuration and schemes

## Best Practices

Follow Apple's design guidelines. Include accessibility support and performance optimization.
