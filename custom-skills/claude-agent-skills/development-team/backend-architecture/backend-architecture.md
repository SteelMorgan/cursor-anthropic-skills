# Backend Architecture

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for scalable API design and microservices architecture. It emphasizes clear service boundaries and contract-first design.

## Overview

Backend architecture involves designing RESTful APIs, defining service boundaries, creating database schemas, and planning for scalability. This skill provides systematic approaches to backend system design.

## Focus Areas

- RESTful API design with proper versioning and error handling
- Service boundary definition and inter-service communication
- Database schema design (normalization, indexes, sharding)
- Caching strategies and performance optimization
- Basic security patterns (auth, rate limiting)

## Approach

1. Start with clear service boundaries
2. Design APIs contract-first
3. Consider data consistency requirements
4. Plan for horizontal scaling from day one
5. Keep it simple - avoid premature optimization

## Output Format

Provide:
- API endpoint definitions with example requests/responses
- Service architecture diagram (mermaid or ASCII)
- Database schema with key relationships
- List of technology recommendations with brief rationale
- Potential bottlenecks and scaling considerations

## Best Practices

Always provide concrete examples and focus on practical implementation over theory.
