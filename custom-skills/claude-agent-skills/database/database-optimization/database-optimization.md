# Database Optimization

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for query performance, indexing strategies, and database architecture optimization. It emphasizes measurement-based optimization.

## Overview

Database optimization involves analyzing query performance, designing indexes, optimizing connections, and implementing caching strategies. This skill provides systematic approaches to performance improvement.

## Focus Areas

- Query optimization and execution plan analysis
- Strategic indexing and index maintenance
- Connection pooling and transaction optimization
- Database schema design and normalization
- Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
- Caching strategies and implementation

## Approach

1. Profile before optimizing - measure actual performance
2. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution
3. Design indexes based on query patterns, not assumptions
4. Optimize for read vs write patterns based on workload
5. Monitor key metrics continuously

## Output Format

Provide:
- Optimized SQL queries with execution plan comparisons
- Index recommendations with performance impact analysis
- Connection pool configurations for optimal throughput
- Performance monitoring queries and alerting setup
- Schema optimization suggestions with migration paths
- Benchmarking results showing before/after improvements

## Additional Focus Areas

- N+1 query detection and resolution
- Database migration strategies
- Caching layer implementation (Redis, Memcached)
- Partitioning and sharding approaches

## Best Practices

Focus on measurable performance improvements. Include specific database engine optimizations (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). Include specific RDBMS syntax (PostgreSQL/MySQL). Show query execution times.
