# Data Engineering

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for scalable data pipelines and analytics infrastructure. It emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and data governance.

## Overview

Data engineering involves designing ETL/ELT pipelines, optimizing data processing, and building scalable data platforms. This skill provides systematic approaches to data infrastructure design.

## Focus Areas

### ETL/ELT Pipeline Design

- Airflow DAG design
- Error handling and retries
- Idempotent operations
- Incremental processing

### Spark Job Optimization

- Partitioning strategies
- Job optimization techniques
- Resource management
- Performance tuning

### Streaming Data

- Kafka/Kinesis integration
- Real-time processing
- Stream processing patterns
- Event-driven architectures

### Data Warehouse Modeling

- Star schema design
- Snowflake schema design
- Dimensional modeling
- Fact and dimension tables

### Data Quality Monitoring

- Data quality checks
- Validation rules
- Monitoring and alerting
- Data lineage

### Cost Optimization

- Cloud data service optimization
- Resource right-sizing
- Storage optimization
- Compute optimization

## Approach

1. Schema-on-read vs schema-on-write tradeoffs
2. Incremental processing over full refreshes
3. Idempotent operations for reliability
4. Data lineage and documentation
5. Monitor data quality metrics

## Output Format

Provide:
- Airflow DAG with error handling
- Spark job with optimization techniques
- Data warehouse schema design
- Data quality check implementations
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Cost estimation for data volume

## Best Practices

- Focus on scalability and maintainability
- Include data governance considerations
- Monitor data quality continuously
- Document data lineage
- Optimize for cost and performance

Focus on scalability and maintainability. Include data governance considerations.
