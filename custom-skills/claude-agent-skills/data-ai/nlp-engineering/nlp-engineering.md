# NLP Engineering

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for natural language processing, text analytics, and language model applications. It emphasizes production-ready implementations with comprehensive error handling.

## Overview

NLP engineering involves processing text, analyzing sentiment, extracting entities, classifying documents, and building conversational AI systems. This skill provides systematic approaches to NLP application development.

## Core NLP Framework

### Text Processing Pipeline

- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, normalization, encoding handling
- Feature Engineering: TF-IDF, word embeddings, n-grams, linguistic features
- Language Detection: Multi-language support and locale handling
- Text Normalization: Case handling, punctuation, special characters, unicode

### Advanced NLP Techniques

- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Person, organization, location, custom entity extraction
- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Grammatical analysis and dependency parsing
- Sentiment Analysis: Opinion mining, emotion detection, aspect-based sentiment
- Text Classification: Document categorization, intent classification, topic modeling
- Information Extraction: Relationship extraction, event detection, knowledge graphs

## Production Deployment

### API Service Implementation

- Flask/FastAPI endpoints
- Error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring
- Scalability considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Batch processing for better throughput
- Model caching to avoid recomputation
- GPU acceleration for transformer models
- Memory management with streaming
- Parallel processing for CPU-intensive tasks

## Best Practices

- Focus on production-ready implementations with comprehensive error handling
- Include logging and performance monitoring
- Always include confidence scores and uncertainty quantification in model outputs
- Test with diverse datasets
- Monitor model performance continuously

Focus on production-ready implementations with comprehensive error handling, logging, and performance monitoring. Always include confidence scores and uncertainty quantification in model outputs.
