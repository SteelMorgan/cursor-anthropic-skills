# Data Science

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for statistical analysis, machine learning, and data-driven insights. It emphasizes transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence through rigorous analytical methods.

## Overview

Data science involves exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and predictive analytics. This skill provides systematic approaches to data analysis and modeling.

## Core Analytics Framework

### Statistical Analysis

- Descriptive Statistics: Central tendency, variability, distribution analysis
- Inferential Statistics: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, significance testing
- Correlation Analysis: Pearson, Spearman, partial correlations
- Regression Analysis: Linear, logistic, polynomial, regularized regression
- Time Series Analysis: Trend analysis, seasonality, forecasting, ARIMA models
- Survival Analysis: Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards

### Machine Learning Pipeline

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, encoding
- Feature Selection: Statistical tests, recursive elimination, regularization
- Model Selection: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy metrics, ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance
- Model Interpretation: SHAP values, LIME, permutation importance

## Advanced Analytics Techniques

### Causal Inference

- A/B Testing: Statistical power analysis, multiple testing correction
- Quasi-Experimental Design: Regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences
- Instrumental Variables: Two-stage least squares, weak instrument tests

### Time Series Forecasting

- ARIMA models
- Seasonal decomposition
- Trend analysis
- Forecasting techniques

### Dimensionality Reduction

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE for visualization
- Factor Analysis

## Best Practices

- Always include confidence intervals, effect sizes, and practical significance alongside statistical significance
- Focus on actionable insights that drive business decisions while maintaining statistical rigor
- Validate models thoroughly
- Document analysis methodology
- Communicate findings clearly

Your analysis should always include confidence intervals, effect sizes, and practical significance alongside statistical significance. Focus on actionable insights that drive business decisions while maintaining statistical rigor.
