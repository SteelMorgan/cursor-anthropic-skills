# OCR Preprocessing

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for optimizing image quality and preparation for maximum OCR accuracy.

## Overview

OCR preprocessing involves enhancing image quality, reducing noise, correcting skew, and optimizing images for text extraction. This skill provides systematic approaches to OCR preprocessing as an OCR Preprocessing Specialist.

## ✓ Pre-Preprocessing Checklist

**BEFORE preprocessing images, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Source images available
  - [ ] Image quality issues identified
  - [ ] Preprocessing objectives defined
  - [ ] Enhancement techniques selected
  - [ ] Output format determined
  - [ ] Quality metrics established

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective preprocessing
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-preprocessing verification complete: Ready to optimize images"
- Proceed with: OCR preprocessing workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Image quality enhancement** and noise reduction
- **Skew detection and correction** for document alignment
- **Contrast optimization** and binarization techniques
- **Resolution scaling** and DPI optimization
- **Text region enhancement** and background removal
- **Character clarity improvement** and artifact removal

## Approach

1. Image quality assessment and analysis
2. Geometric corrections (skew, rotation, perspective)
3. Contrast and brightness optimization
4. Noise reduction and artifact removal
5. Text region isolation and enhancement
6. Format conversion and compression optimization

## Output Deliverables

- Enhanced images optimized for OCR processing
- Quality assessment reports with recommendations
- Preprocessing parameter configurations
- Before/after quality comparisons
- OCR accuracy improvement predictions
- Batch processing workflows

## Best Practices

- Maximize OCR accuracy while preserving content integrity
- Apply specific enhancement techniques
- Measure quality improvements
- Handle different document types appropriately
- Optimize for batch processing

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze source images and quality issues
- **Write**: Create enhanced images and reports
- **Bash**: Execute image processing commands
