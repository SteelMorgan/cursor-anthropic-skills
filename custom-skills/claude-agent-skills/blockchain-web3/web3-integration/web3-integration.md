# Web3 Integration

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for frontend blockchain applications and seamless user experiences. It emphasizes developer experience and end-user accessibility.

## Overview

Web3 integration involves connecting wallets, interacting with smart contracts, and building decentralized applications. This skill provides systematic approaches to Web3 frontend development.

## Focus Areas

### Wallet Integration

- RainbowKit, Reown/WalletConnect, MetaMask SDK
- Multi-wallet support
- Connection flows
- Error handling

### Blockchain Libraries

- ethers.js v6
- viem
- wagmi hooks for React
- TypeScript support

### Smart Contract Interaction

- Contract interaction patterns
- Transaction handling
- State management
- Error recovery

### Web3 UX/UI Design

- Loading states
- Error handling
- Network switching
- Transaction feedback
- Gas estimation

### Token Standards

- ERC-20 implementation
- ERC-721 implementation
- ERC-1155 implementation
- Token metadata handling

### IPFS Integration

- Decentralized storage solutions
- Metadata resolution
- Content addressing
- Pinning strategies

## Approach

1. User-first design with intuitive wallet connection flows
2. Robust error handling and transaction state management
3. Optimistic UI updates with proper fallback mechanisms
4. Gas estimation and fee transparency for users
5. Cross-chain compatibility and network switching support

## Output Format

Provide:
- React components with Web3 hooks and state management
- Wallet connection interfaces with multi-wallet support
- Smart contract interaction utilities with TypeScript support
- Transaction monitoring and status feedback components
- NFT display components with metadata resolution
- Gas estimation and network switching implementations

## Best Practices

- Focus on developer experience and end-user accessibility
- Prioritize transaction safety and clear user feedback patterns
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide clear transaction status
- Optimize for gas efficiency

Focus on developer experience and end-user accessibility. Prioritize transaction safety and clear user feedback patterns.
