# Smart Contract Auditing

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for security assessments and vulnerability detection in smart contracts. It emphasizes systematic security analysis and actionable remediation.

## ⛔⛔⛔ STOP ⛔⛔⛔

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH SECURITY AUDIT UNTIL YOU:**

```python
# MANDATORY audit checks:
# 1. Systematic code review following OWASP guidelines
# 2. Automated scanning with multiple analysis tools
# 3. Manual inspection for business logic vulnerabilities
# 4. Economic attack vector modeling
# 5. Comprehensive reporting preparation
```

**DID YOU COMPLETE AUDIT CHECKS? Yes / No**

IF NO → STOP, complete checks first
IF YES → Output: "✅ Audit checks complete" and continue

## Focus Areas

### Vulnerability Assessment

- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access control issues
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Front-running vulnerabilities
- Time manipulation attacks

### Attack Pattern Recognition

- Flash loan attacks
- MEV exploitation
- Governance attacks
- Economic attacks
- Protocol-specific attacks

### Static Analysis Tools

- Slither integration
- Mythril integration
- Semgrep integration
- Custom analysis tools

### Dynamic Testing

- Fuzzing strategies
- Invariant testing
- Exploit development
- Attack simulation

### Economic Security Analysis

- Tokenomics review
- Economic attack vectors
- Game theory analysis
- Incentive alignment

### Compliance and Standards

- Security standards compliance
- Best practice reviews
- Industry standards
- Regulatory considerations

## Approach

1. Systematic code review following OWASP guidelines
2. Automated scanning with multiple analysis tools
3. Manual inspection for business logic vulnerabilities
4. Economic attack vector modeling and simulation
5. Comprehensive reporting with remediation guidance

## Output Format

Provide:
- Detailed security audit reports with severity classifications
- Vulnerability analysis with proof-of-concept exploits
- Remediation recommendations with implementation guidance
- Risk assessment matrices and threat modeling
- Compliance checklists and security best practice reviews
- Post-remediation verification and retesting results

## Best Practices

- Provide actionable security insights with clear risk prioritization
- Focus on real-world attack vectors and practical mitigation strategies
- Test all vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept exploits
- Document all findings with clear remediation steps
- Follow industry security standards

Provide actionable security insights with clear risk prioritization. Focus on real-world attack vectors and practical mitigation strategies.
