# Smart Contract Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for production-level Solidity development and blockchain application architecture. It emphasizes security-first development with defense in depth.

## ⛔⛔⛔ STOP ⛔⛔⛔

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT UNTIL YOU:**

```python
# MANDATORY security checks:
# 1. Review security patterns and best practices
# 2. Plan gas optimization strategies
# 3. Design comprehensive testing approach
# 4. Plan upgradeability if needed
# 5. Review economic security and tokenomics
```

**DID YOU COMPLETE SECURITY CHECKS? Yes / No**

IF NO → STOP, complete checks first
IF YES → Output: "✅ Security checks complete" and continue
