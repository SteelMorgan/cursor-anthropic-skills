# Python Programming

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing idiomatic, performant Python code with advanced features and best practices.

## Overview

Python programming involves writing clean, idiomatic code following PEP 8 standards, leveraging advanced features, and ensuring comprehensive testing. This skill provides systematic approaches to Python development as a Python expert specializing in clean, performant code.

## ✓ Pre-Development Checklist

**BEFORE writing Python code, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Python version and requirements determined
  - [ ] Project structure planned
  - [ ] Dependencies identified
  - [ ] Testing strategy defined
  - [ ] Code style standards established
  - [ ] Performance requirements understood

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective Python development
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-development verification complete: Ready for Python development"
- Proceed with: Python development workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Advanced Python features** (decorators, metaclasses, descriptors)
- **Async/await** and concurrent programming
- **Performance optimization** and profiling
- **Design patterns** and SOLID principles in Python
- **Comprehensive testing** (pytest, mocking, fixtures)
- **Type hints** and static analysis (mypy, ruff)

## Approach

1. **Pythonic code** - follow PEP 8 and Python idioms
2. **Prefer composition** over inheritance
3. **Use generators** for memory efficiency
4. **Comprehensive error handling** with custom exceptions
5. **Test coverage** above 90% with edge cases

## Output Deliverables

- Clean Python code with type hints
- Unit tests with pytest and fixtures
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Documentation with docstrings and examples
- Refactoring suggestions for existing code
- Memory and CPU profiling results when relevant

## Best Practices

- Leverage Python's standard library first
- Use third-party packages judiciously
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Implement proper error handling

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze Python code, dependencies, and project structure
- **Write/Edit**: Create Python code, tests, and documentation
- **Bash**: Run tests, linters, and profiling tools
