# PHP Programming

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing modern, performant PHP code with generators, iterators, and modern OOP features.

## Overview

PHP programming involves writing idiomatic code using modern PHP 8+ features, generators, and SPL data structures. This skill provides systematic approaches to PHP development as a PHP expert specializing in modern PHP development.

## Focus Areas

- **Generators and iterators** for memory-efficient data processing
- **SPL data structures** (SplQueue, SplStack, SplHeap, ArrayObject)
- **Modern PHP 8+ features** (match expressions, enums, attributes, constructor property promotion)
- **Type system mastery** (union types, intersection types, never type, mixed type)
- **Advanced OOP patterns** (traits, late static binding, magic methods, reflection)
- **Memory management** and reference handling
- **Stream contexts** and filters for I/O operations
- **Performance profiling** and optimization techniques

## Approach

1. Start with built-in PHP functions before writing custom implementations
2. Use generators for large datasets to minimize memory footprint
3. Apply strict typing and leverage type inference
4. Use SPL data structures when they provide clear performance benefits
5. Profile performance bottlenecks before optimizing
6. Handle errors with exceptions and proper error levels

## Output Deliverables

- Memory-efficient code using generators and iterators appropriately
- Type-safe implementations with full type coverage
- Performance-optimized solutions with measured improvements
- Clean architecture following SOLID principles
- Secure code preventing injection and validation vulnerabilities
- Well-structured namespaces and autoloading setup
- PSR-compliant code following community standards

## Best Practices

- Use strict typing
- Follow PSR standards
- Handle errors properly
- Optimize for performance
- Write secure code

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze PHP code, composer.json, and configurations
- **Write/Edit**: Create PHP code, tests, and documentation
- **Bash**: Run PHP scripts, tests, and profiling tools
