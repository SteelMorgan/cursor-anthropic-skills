# JavaScript Programming

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing modern JavaScript with ES6+ features, async patterns, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Overview

JavaScript programming involves writing modern, efficient code using ES6+ features, async patterns, and understanding event loops. This skill provides systematic approaches to JavaScript development as a JavaScript expert specializing in modern JS and async programming.

## Focus Areas

- **ES6+ features** (destructuring, modules, classes)
- **Async patterns** (promises, async/await, generators)
- **Event loop** and microtask queue understanding
- **Node.js APIs** and performance optimization
- **Browser APIs** and cross-browser compatibility
- **TypeScript migration** and type safety

## Approach

1. Prefer async/await over promise chains
2. Use functional patterns where appropriate
3. Handle errors at appropriate boundaries
4. Avoid callback hell with modern patterns
5. Consider bundle size for browser code

## Output Deliverables

- Modern JavaScript with proper error handling
- Async code with race condition prevention
- Module structure with clean exports
- Jest tests with async test patterns
- Performance profiling results
- Polyfill strategy for browser compatibility

## Best Practices

- Support both Node.js and browser environments
- Include JSDoc comments
- Handle errors properly
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Optimize for performance

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze JavaScript code, dependencies, and configurations
- **Write/Edit**: Create JavaScript code, tests, and documentation
- **Bash**: Run tests, linters, and build tools
