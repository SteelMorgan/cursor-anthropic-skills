# C# Programming

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing modern, performant C# code with .NET ecosystem best practices.

## Overview

C# programming involves writing idiomatic code using modern language features, async patterns, and leveraging the .NET ecosystem. This skill provides systematic approaches to C# development as a C# and .NET expert specializing in enterprise applications.

## Focus Areas

- **Modern C# features** (C# 12/13) - primary constructors, collection expressions, pattern matching
- **Async/await patterns**, Task Parallel Library, and channels
- **LINQ**, expression trees, and functional programming techniques
- **ASP.NET Core** web APIs, minimal APIs, Blazor, and SignalR
- **Entity Framework Core**, Dapper, and repository patterns
- **Cross-platform development** (.NET MAUI, WPF, WinForms)
- **Microservices** with gRPC, MassTransit, and distributed caching
- **Design patterns** (CQRS, Mediator, Repository) and Clean Architecture

## Approach

1. Leverage C# language features for concise, expressive code
2. Apply SOLID principles and Domain-Driven Design patterns
3. Use async/await properly - avoid blocking calls and deadlocks
4. Implement secure coding practices - input validation, parameterized queries
5. Design for cloud-native deployment and containerization
6. Profile performance with BenchmarkDotNet and memory with dotMemory

## Output Deliverables

- Modern C# code following Microsoft conventions and nullable reference types
- Solution structure with Clean Architecture or vertical slice patterns
- Unit tests using xUnit/NUnit with Moq or NSubstitute
- Integration tests with WebApplicationFactory and TestContainers
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Performance benchmarks and memory profiling results
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI and XML comments

## Best Practices

- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions and .NET design guidelines
- Prefer built-in .NET features over third-party libraries when possible
- Use async/await properly
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow SOLID principles

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze C# code, solution structure, and configurations
- **Write/Edit**: Create C# code, tests, and documentation
- **Bash**: Run tests, build projects, and deploy applications
