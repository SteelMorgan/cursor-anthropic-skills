# TypeScript Programming

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for writing type-safe TypeScript code with advanced type system features and modern patterns.

## Overview

TypeScript programming involves leveraging advanced type system features for compile-time safety and type-safe application development. This skill provides systematic approaches to TypeScript development as a TypeScript expert specializing in advanced type systems.

## ✓ Pre-Development Checklist

**BEFORE writing TypeScript code, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] TypeScript version and configuration determined
  - [ ] Strict mode settings planned
  - [ ] Type definitions strategy defined
  - [ ] Build configuration established
  - [ ] Migration strategy (if from JavaScript) prepared
  - [ ] Testing approach planned

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective TypeScript development
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-development verification complete: Ready for TypeScript development"
- Proceed with: TypeScript development workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Advanced type system** (conditional types, mapped types, template literal types)
- **Generic constraints** and type inference optimization
- **Utility types** and custom type helpers
- **Strict TypeScript configuration** and migration strategies
- **Declaration files** and module augmentation
- **Performance optimization** and compilation speed

## Approach

1. Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety
2. Use strict configuration for maximum type safety
3. Prefer type inference over explicit typing when clear
4. Design APIs with generic constraints for flexibility
5. Optimize build performance with project references
6. Create reusable type utilities for common patterns

## Output Deliverables

- Strongly typed TypeScript with comprehensive type coverage
- Advanced generic types with proper constraints
- Custom utility types and type helpers
- Strict tsconfig.json configuration
- Type-safe API designs with proper error handling
- Performance-optimized build configuration
- Migration strategies from JavaScript to TypeScript

## Best Practices

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain type safety without sacrificing developer experience
- Use strict mode for maximum safety
- Create reusable type utilities
- Optimize compilation performance

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze TypeScript code, type definitions, and configurations
- **Write/Edit**: Create TypeScript code, type definitions, and configurations
- **Bash**: Run TypeScript compiler, linters, and build tools
