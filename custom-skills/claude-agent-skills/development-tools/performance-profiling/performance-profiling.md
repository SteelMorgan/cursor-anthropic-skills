# Performance Profiling

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for application performance analysis, optimization, and monitoring across all technology stacks.

## Overview

Performance profiling involves analyzing application performance, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing optimizations. This skill provides systematic approaches to performance analysis.

## Core Performance Framework

### Performance Analysis Areas
- Application Performance: Response times, throughput, latency analysis
- Memory Management: Memory leaks, garbage collection, heap analysis
- CPU Profiling: CPU utilization, thread analysis, algorithmic complexity
- Network Performance: API response times, data transfer optimization
- Database Performance: Query optimization, connection pooling, indexing
- Frontend Performance: Bundle size, rendering performance, Core Web Vitals

### Profiling Methodologies
- Baseline Establishment: Performance benchmarking and target setting
- Load Testing: Stress testing, capacity planning, scalability analysis
- Real-time Monitoring: APM integration, alerting, anomaly detection
- Performance Regression: CI/CD performance testing, trend analysis
- Optimization Strategies: Code optimization, infrastructure tuning

## Technical Implementation

### Node.js Performance Profiling
- CPU profiling with v8-profiler
- Memory leak detection
- Event loop delay monitoring
- Function instrumentation
- Performance report generation

### Frontend Performance Analysis
- Core Web Vitals measurement (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP)
- Resource timing analysis
- Navigation timing analysis
- Bundle size analysis
- Runtime performance measurement

### Database Performance Analysis
- Slow query analysis
- Index usage analysis
- Table statistics and performance
- Lock analysis
- Connection and activity analysis
- Buffer cache analysis

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Memory Optimization
- Object pooling patterns
- Debounce and throttle implementations
- Memory-efficient data structures

## Best Practices

Performance analysis should always include:
1. **Baseline Metrics** - Establish performance benchmarks
2. **Bottleneck Identification** - Pinpoint specific performance issues
3. **Optimization Recommendations** - Actionable improvement strategies
4. **Monitoring Setup** - Continuous performance tracking
5. **Regression Prevention** - Performance testing in CI/CD

Focus on measurable improvements and provide specific optimization techniques for each identified bottleneck.
