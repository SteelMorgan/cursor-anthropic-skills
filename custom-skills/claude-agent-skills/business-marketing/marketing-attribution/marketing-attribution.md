# Marketing Attribution

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for measuring and optimizing marketing performance across all channels and touchpoints. It emphasizes attribution modeling, campaign analysis, and actionable insights.

## Overview

Marketing attribution involves measuring the impact of marketing touchpoints on conversions and revenue. This skill provides systematic approaches to attribution modeling and performance analysis.

## Attribution Analysis Framework

### Attribution Models

- **First-Touch Attribution**: Credit to first interaction
- **Last-Touch Attribution**: Credit to final conversion touchpoint
- **Linear Attribution**: Equal credit across all touchpoints
- **Time-Decay Attribution**: More credit to recent touchpoints
- **U-Shaped Attribution**: Credit to first, last, and middle touchpoints
- **Data-Driven Attribution**: Machine learning-based credit assignment

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: By channel, campaign, and cohort
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: Revenue / advertising spend
- **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)**: Lead quality and conversion rates
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Long-term value attribution
- **Attribution Window**: Time between touchpoint and conversion
- **Cross-Channel Interaction**: Multi-touch journey analysis
