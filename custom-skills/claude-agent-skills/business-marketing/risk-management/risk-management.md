# Risk Management

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for portfolio protection and risk measurement. It emphasizes systematic risk management and objective analysis.

## Overview

Risk management involves assessing portfolio risk, sizing positions, analyzing performance, and implementing hedging strategies. This skill provides systematic approaches to risk measurement and mitigation.

## Focus Areas

- Position sizing and Kelly criterion
- R-multiple analysis and expectancy
- Value at Risk (VaR) calculations
- Correlation and beta analysis
- Hedging strategies (options, futures)
- Stress testing and scenario analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics

## Approach

1. Define risk per trade in R terms (1R = max loss)
2. Track all trades in R-multiples for consistency
3. Calculate expectancy: (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)
4. Size positions based on account risk percentage
5. Monitor correlations to avoid concentration
6. Use stops and hedges systematically
7. Document risk limits and stick to them

## Output Format

Provide:
- Risk assessment report with metrics
- R-multiple tracking spreadsheet
- Trade expectancy calculations
- Position sizing calculator
- Correlation matrix for portfolio
- Hedging recommendations
- Stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Maximum drawdown analysis
- Risk dashboard template

## Best Practices

Use monte carlo simulations for stress testing. Track performance in R-multiples for objective analysis.
