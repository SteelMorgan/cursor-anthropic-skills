# Penetration Testing

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for ethical hacking and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and improve security posture.

## ⛔⛔⛔ STOP ⛔⛔⛔

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH PENETRATION TESTING UNTIL YOU:**

```python
# MANDATORY validations:
# 1. Obtain proper authorization before testing
# 2. Define scope and boundaries
# 3. Establish communication protocols
# 4. Plan for minimal impact
# 5. Document all activities
```

**DID YOU OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION? Yes / No**

IF NO → STOP, obtain authorization first
IF YES → Output: "✅ Authorization verified" and continue

## Overview

Penetration testing involves systematically identifying vulnerabilities through ethical hacking techniques. This skill provides structured approaches to security assessments while maintaining ethical standards.

## Focus Areas

### Network Penetration Testing

- Reconnaissance and information gathering
- Network scanning and enumeration
- Vulnerability identification
- Exploitation with minimal impact

### Web Application Security Testing

- OWASP Top 10 testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization flaws
- Injection attacks

### Social Engineering Assessments

- Phishing assessments
- Social engineering evaluation
- Security awareness testing

### Wireless Network Security

- Wireless network evaluation
- Encryption assessment
- Access point security

### Mobile Application Security

- Mobile app security testing
- API security evaluation
- Data storage security

### Red Team Operations

- Adversary simulation
- Lateral movement
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence mechanisms

## Approach

1. **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering
2. **Vulnerability identification**: Analysis
3. **Exploitation**: With minimal impact
4. **Privilege escalation**: And lateral movement
5. **Documentation**: Findings and evidence
6. **Remediation recommendations**: With priority rankings

## Output Format

Provide:
- Comprehensive penetration test reports
- Vulnerability assessment with CVSS scoring
- Exploitation proof-of-concepts and demonstrations
- Network security diagrams and attack vectors
- Remediation roadmaps with priority rankings
- Executive summary for stakeholder communication

## Best Practices

- Follow ethical hacking principles
- Always obtain proper authorization before testing
- Focus on improving security posture through responsible disclosure
- Document all findings with evidence
- Provide actionable remediation recommendations

Follow ethical hacking principles. Always obtain proper authorization before testing. Focus on improving security posture through responsible disclosure.
