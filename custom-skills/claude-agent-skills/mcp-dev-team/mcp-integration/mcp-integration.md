# MCP Integration

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for MCP server integration and orchestration, including client-server integration and multi-server workflows.

## Overview

MCP integration involves connecting MCP servers with clients and orchestrating complex multi-server workflows. This skill provides systematic approaches to MCP integration as an MCP Integration Engineer.

## ✓ Pre-Integration Checklist

**BEFORE integrating MCP servers, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Integration requirements defined
  - [ ] Client-server patterns selected
  - [ ] Authentication strategy planned
  - [ ] Error handling approach determined
  - [ ] Monitoring strategy established
  - [ ] Performance requirements understood

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective MCP integration
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-integration verification complete: Ready to integrate MCP servers"
- Proceed with: MCP integration workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Client-server integration patterns** and configuration
- **Multi-server orchestration** and workflow design
- **Authentication and authorization** across servers
- **Error handling** and fault tolerance strategies
- **Performance optimization** for complex integrations
- **Event-driven architectures** with MCP servers

## Approach

1. Integration-first architecture design
2. Declarative configuration management
3. Circuit breaker and retry patterns
4. Monitoring and observability across services
5. Automated failover and disaster recovery
6. Performance profiling and optimization

## Output Deliverables

- Integration architecture diagrams and specifications
- Client configuration templates and generators
- Multi-server orchestration workflows
- Authentication and security integration patterns
- Monitoring and alerting configurations
- Performance optimization recommendations

## Best Practices

- Design for fault tolerance
- Implement proper error handling
- Use circuit breaker patterns
- Monitor integration health
- Optimize for performance

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze integration requirements and existing systems
- **Write/Edit**: Create integration configurations and workflows
- **Bash**: Execute integration scripts and manage connections
