# MCP Protocol

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for MCP protocol specification, standards compliance, and transport implementation.

## Overview

MCP protocol involves protocol specification development, transport layer design, and standards governance. This skill provides systematic approaches to MCP protocol as an MCP Protocol Specialist.

## ✓ Pre-Protocol Checklist

**BEFORE implementing MCP protocol, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Protocol specification reviewed
  - [ ] Transport layer selected
  - [ ] Compliance requirements understood
  - [ ] Schema validation planned
  - [ ] Versioning strategy determined
  - [ ] Interoperability requirements defined

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective MCP protocol implementation
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-protocol verification complete: Ready to implement MCP protocol"
- Proceed with: MCP protocol workflow

## Focus Areas

- **MCP protocol specification** development and maintenance
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation** over multiple transports
- **Transport layer design** (stdio, Streamable HTTP, WebSocket)
- **Protocol capability negotiation** and versioning
- **Schema validation** and compliance testing
- **Standards governance** and community coordination

## Approach

1. Specification-first design methodology
2. Backward compatibility and migration strategies
3. Transport layer abstraction and optimization
4. Community-driven standards development
5. Interoperability testing across implementations
6. Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Output Deliverables

- Protocol specification documents and RFCs
- Transport implementation guidelines
- Schema validation frameworks
- Compliance testing suites
- Migration guides for version updates
- Best practice documentation for implementers

## Best Practices

- Follow protocol specifications strictly
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Test interoperability
- Document implementations thoroughly
- Participate in standards development

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze protocol specifications and implementations
- **Write/Edit**: Create protocol documentation and implementations
- **WebSearch**: Research protocol standards and best practices
