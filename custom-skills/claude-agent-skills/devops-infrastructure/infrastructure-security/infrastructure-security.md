description: This skill provides expertise in security infrastructure and compliance. This skill should be used for security architecture, compliance frameworks, vulnerability management, security automation, or incident response. Focuses on Zero Trust and automation first.
enforcement_level: CRITICAL
violation_consequence: Security vulnerabilities may remain undetected, compliance violations may occur, or incidents may escalate, causing data breaches

# Infrastructure Security

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for infrastructure security, compliance automation, and security operations. It emphasizes Zero Trust architecture and automation-first security.

## ⛔⛔⛔ STOP ⛔⛔⛔

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL YOU:**

```python
# MANDATORY security validations:
# 1. Review security requirements and compliance needs
# 2. Identify security domains and controls
# 3. Plan security architecture (Zero Trust)
# 4. Design automation and monitoring
# 5. Plan incident response procedures
```

**DID YOU COMPLETE VALIDATIONS? Yes / No**

IF NO → STOP, validate first
IF YES → Output: "✅ Security prerequisites validated" and continue

## 🔒 Security Implementation Gate System

### Gate 1: Security Architecture ✋ STOP HERE FIRST
- **Action**: Design Zero Trust architecture with defense in depth
- **Verify**: Security layers, access controls, encryption
- **Confirmation**: "Gate 1 cleared: Security architecture designed"

### Gate 2: Compliance Framework ✋ STOP HERE SECOND
- **Action**: Implement compliance automation (SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
- **Verify**: Compliance controls, monitoring, reporting
- **Confirmation**: "Gate 2 cleared: Compliance framework implemented"

### Gate 3: Security Monitoring ✋ STOP HERE THIRD
- **Action**: Set up continuous security monitoring and alerting
- **Verify**: Threat detection, log aggregation, alerting
- **Confirmation**: "Gate 3 cleared: Security monitoring active"

### Gate 4: Incident Response ✋ STOP HERE FOURTH
- **Action**: Implement automated incident response procedures
- **Verify**: Response automation, runbooks, recovery procedures
- **Confirmation**: "Gate 4 cleared: Incident response ready"

## 🚦 Final Security Checkpoint

**Verify all gates cleared:**

```
✅ SECURITY STATUS
- Gate 1: [CLEARED / BLOCKED]
- Gate 2: [CLEARED / BLOCKED]
- Gate 3: [CLEARED / BLOCKED]
- Gate 4: [CLEARED / BLOCKED]

Ready for production: [YES / NO]
```

**IF ANY GATE BLOCKED:**
- ❌ STOP immediately
- Complete: [Missing gate]
- Then: Resume from next gate

## Core Security Framework

### Security Domains

- **Infrastructure Security**: Network security, IAM, encryption, secrets management
- **Application Security**: SAST/DAST, dependency scanning, secure development
- **Compliance**: SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR automation and monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Security monitoring, threat detection, incident automation
- **Cloud Security**: Cloud security posture, CSPM, cloud-native security tools

### Security Architecture Principles

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify, least privilege access
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
- **Security by Design**: Built-in security from architecture phase
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- **Automation First**: Automated security controls and incident response

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify approach
2. **Automation First**: Automated security controls and response
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
4. **Compliance by Design**: Built-in compliance controls and reporting
5. **Incident Preparedness**: Automated incident response and recovery

## Best Practices

- Always include comprehensive logging, monitoring, and audit trails
- Implement security by design from the start
- Automate security controls and responses
- Monitor security continuously
- Prepare for incidents with automation

Always include comprehensive logging, monitoring, and audit trails for all security controls and activities.
