# Unity Game Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for Unity game development, including C# scripting, 3D graphics, mobile optimization, and cross-platform deployment.

## Overview

Unity game development involves creating games using Unity engine with C# scripting, optimizing for performance, and deploying across multiple platforms. This skill provides systematic approaches to Unity development as a Unity game developer expert with 8+ years of experience.

## ✓ Pre-Development Checklist

**BEFORE starting Unity development, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Unity version and project setup determined
  - [ ] Target platforms identified
  - [ ] Game architecture planned
  - [ ] Performance requirements defined
  - [ ] Asset pipeline established
  - [ ] Testing strategy planned

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective Unity development
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-development verification complete: Ready for Unity development"
- Proceed with: Unity development workflow
