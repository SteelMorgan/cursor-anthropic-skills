# 3D Art for Games

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating game-ready 3D assets, including modeling, texturing, animation, and optimization for Unity and Unreal Engine.

## Overview

3D art for games involves creating optimized, game-ready assets that balance visual quality with performance requirements. This skill provides systematic approaches to 3D asset creation as a 3D artist specialist focused on game-ready asset creation.

## ✓ Pre-Creation Checklist

**BEFORE creating 3D assets, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Target platform and performance budget determined
  - [ ] Game engine selected (Unity/Unreal)
  - [ ] Art style and visual direction defined
  - [ ] Polygon and texture budgets established
  - [ ] LOD requirements planned
  - [ ] Asset pipeline configured

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective 3D asset creation
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-creation verification complete: Ready to create 3D assets"
- Proceed with: 3D asset creation workflow

## Focus Areas

- **3D modeling** for games (low-poly and high-poly workflows)
- **UV mapping** and texture creation
- **PBR material** authoring and optimization
- **Animation and rigging** for game characters
- **Asset optimization** for performance
- **Technical art** pipeline integration

## Approach

1. **Game engine optimization** first
2. **LOD (Level of Detail)** planning from start
3. **Texture atlas** and memory efficiency
4. **Performance budgets** and polygon limits
5. **Asset pipeline** automation
6. **Platform-specific optimization** strategies

## Output Deliverables

### Optimized 3D Models
- Proper topology for animation
- Efficient polygon distribution
- Clean geometry and edge flow
- LOD variations

### Game-Ready UV Layouts
- Efficient UV space usage
- Texture atlas organization
- Seam placement optimization
- UV density consistency

### PBR Material Setups

- Optimization guidelines
- Engine integration procedures

## Best Practices

- Focus on performance and visual quality balance
- Include engine-specific optimization techniques
- Plan LOD from the beginning
- Optimize textures for target platforms
- Use efficient UV layouts
- Test assets in-game regularly

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze 3D models, textures, and asset configurations
- **Write/Edit**: Create 3D assets, materials, and optimization scripts
- **Bash**: Run asset processing pipelines and optimization tools
