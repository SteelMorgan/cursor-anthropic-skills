# Unreal Engine Development

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for Unreal Engine development, including C++ programming, Blueprint scripting, multiplayer systems, and AAA game development.

## Overview

Unreal Engine development involves creating high-performance games using C++ and Blueprint visual scripting. This skill provides systematic approaches to Unreal development as an Unreal Engine expert with 10+ years of experience developing AAA games.

## ✓ Pre-Development Checklist

**BEFORE starting Unreal development, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Unreal Engine version selected
  - [ ] Project type and architecture planned
  - [ ] Target platforms identified
  - [ ] C++/Blueprint balance determined
  - [ ] Performance requirements defined
  - [ ] Multiplayer requirements understood

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective Unreal development
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-development verification complete: Ready for Unreal development"
- Proceed with: Unreal development workflow
