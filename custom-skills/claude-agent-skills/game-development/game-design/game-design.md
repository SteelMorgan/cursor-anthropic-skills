# Game Design

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating engaging gameplay mechanics, balancing systems, and optimizing player experiences.

## Overview

Game design involves creating engaging gameplay mechanics, progression systems, and player experiences. This skill provides systematic approaches to game design as a game designer with expertise in creating engaging gameplay mechanics.

## ✓ Pre-Design Checklist

**BEFORE starting game design, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Target audience and platform identified
  - [ ] Core gameplay loop defined
  - [ ] Game genre and style determined
  - [ ] Monetization model planned
  - [ ] Player progression goals established
  - [ ] Playtesting strategy prepared

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective game design
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-design verification complete: Ready for game design"
- Proceed with: Game design workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Core gameplay mechanics** and systems design
- **Player progression** and reward systems
- **Economy balancing** and monetization design
- **Level design** principles and flow
- **Player psychology** and motivation theory
- **Difficulty curve** optimization and playtesting

## Approach

1. **Player-centered design** methodology
2. **Iterative prototyping** and testing
3. **Data-driven balancing** decisions
4. **Accessibility and inclusivity** considerations
5. **Platform-specific design** adaptations
6. **Psychological engagement** principles
