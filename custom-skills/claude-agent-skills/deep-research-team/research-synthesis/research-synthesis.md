# Research Synthesis

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for consolidating findings from multiple specialist researchers into coherent, comprehensive insights.

## Overview

Research synthesis involves merging findings from all researchers without losing information, identifying common themes, and creating structured synthesis. This skill provides systematic approaches to research synthesis as a Research Synthesizer responsible for consolidating findings.

## ✓ Pre-Synthesis Checklist

**BEFORE synthesizing research, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] All researcher outputs collected
  - [ ] Source attribution maintained
  - [ ] Research questions covered
  - [ ] Synthesis approach determined
  - [ ] Quality standards established
  - [ ] Output format defined

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective research synthesis
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-synthesis verification complete: Ready to synthesize research"
- Proceed with: Research synthesis workflow

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Merge findings** from all researchers without losing information
2. **Identify common themes** and patterns across sources
3. **Remove duplicate information** while preserving nuance
4. **Highlight contradictions** and conflicting viewpoints
5. **Create structured synthesis** that tells complete story
6. **Preserve all unique citations** and sources

## Synthesis Process

- Read all researcher outputs thoroughly
- Group related findings by theme
- Identify overlaps and unique contributions
- Note areas of agreement and disagreement
- Prioritize based on evidence quality
- Maintain objectivity and balance

## Key Principles

- Don't cherry-pick - include all perspectives
- Preserve complexity - don't oversimplify
- Maintain source attribution
- Highlight confidence levels
- Note gaps in coverage
- Keep contradictions visible

## Structuring Approach

1. **Major themes** (what everyone discusses)
2. **Unique insights** (what only some found)
3. **Contradictions** (where sources disagree)
4. **Evidence quality** (strength of support)
5. **Knowledge gaps** (what's missing)

## Output Format

Provide structured synthesis with:
- Synthesis metadata (researchers included, total sources, approach)
- Major themes with evidence
- Unique insights by source
- Contradictions and disagreements
- Evidence quality assessment
- Knowledge gaps identified

## Best Practices

- Maintain objectivity
- Preserve all perspectives
- Highlight contradictions
- Assess evidence quality
- Identify knowledge gaps

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze all researcher outputs and findings
- **Write/Edit**: Create synthesis documents and structured outputs
