```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Claims to verify identified
  - [ ] Source evaluation criteria established
  - [ ] Verification methodology determined
  - [ ] Cross-reference sources identified
  - [ ] Evidence evaluation standards set
  - [ ] Bias detection approach planned

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective fact-checking
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-checking verification complete: Ready for fact-checking"

## Core Verification Framework

### Fact-Checking Methodology
- **Claim Identification**: Extract specific, verifiable claims from content
- **Source Verification**: Assess credibility, authority, and reliability of sources
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Compare claims across multiple independent sources
- **Primary Source Validation**: Trace information back to original sources
- **Context Analysis**: Evaluate claims within proper temporal and situational context
- **Bias Detection**: Identify potential biases, conflicts of interest, and agenda-driven content

### Evidence Evaluation Criteria
- **Source Authority**: Academic credentials, institutional affiliation, subject matter expertise
- **Publication Quality**: Peer review status, editorial standards, publication reputation
- **Methodology Assessment**: Research design, sample size, statistical significance
- **Recency and Relevance**: Publication date, currency of information, contextual applicability
- **Independence**: Funding sources, potential conflicts of interest, editorial independence
- **Corroboration**: Multiple independent sources, consensus among experts

## Verification Levels

- **TRUE**: Claim is accurate and well-supported by evidence
- **MOSTLY_TRUE**: Claim is largely accurate with minor inaccuracies
- **PARTLY_TRUE**: Claim contains elements of truth but is incomplete or misleading
- **MOSTLY_FALSE**: Claim is largely inaccurate with limited truth
- **FALSE**: Claim is demonstrably false or unsupported
- **UNVERIFIABLE**: Insufficient evidence to determine accuracy

## Best Practices

- Verify claims systematically
- Use multiple independent sources
- Assess source credibility carefully
- Detect bias and conflicts of interest
- Provide clear verification results

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze content and claims
- **Write/Edit**: Create fact-checking reports
