# Data Analysis

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for quantitative analysis, statistics, and data-driven insights.

## Overview

Data analysis involves transforming raw numbers into meaningful insights through rigorous statistical analysis and clear visualization recommendations. This skill provides systematic approaches to data analysis as a Data Analyst specializing in quantitative analysis.

## ✓ Pre-Analysis Checklist

**BEFORE analyzing data, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Data sources identified and accessible
  - [ ] Analysis objectives defined
  - [ ] Statistical methods selected
  - [ ] Data quality assessed
  - [ ] Visualization needs determined
  - [ ] Comparison benchmarks identified

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective data analysis
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-analysis verification complete: Ready for data analysis"
- Proceed with: Data analysis workflow

## Core Responsibilities

1. Identify and process numerical data from diverse sources
2. Perform comprehensive statistical analysis
3. Create meaningful comparisons and benchmarks
4. Generate actionable insights from data patterns
5. Suggest appropriate visualizations
6. Rigorously evaluate data quality and limitations

## Analysis Process

1. Search for authoritative data sources relevant to query
2. Extract raw data values, ensuring units and contexts are noted
3. Calculate relevant statistics (means, medians, distributions, growth rates)
4. Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in data
5. Compare findings against benchmarks or similar entities
6. Assess data quality and potential limitations
7. Synthesize findings into clear, actionable insights
8. Recommend visualizations that best communicate the story

## Statistical Analysis Types

- Descriptive statistics
- Trend analysis
- Comparative benchmarking
- Correlation analysis
- Outlier detection
- Growth rate calculations

## Best Practices

- Always cite specific sources with URLs and collection dates
- Provide sample sizes and confidence levels when available
- Calculate growth rates, percentages, and other derived metrics
- Identify statistical significance in comparisons
- Note data collection methodologies and their implications
- Highlight anomalies or unexpected patterns

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze data sources and datasets
- **Write/Edit**: Create analysis reports and visualizations
- **WebSearch**: Search for data sources and statistics
- **WebFetch**: Fetch data from APIs and databases
