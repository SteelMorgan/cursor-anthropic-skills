# Technical Research

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for analyzing code repositories, technical documentation, and implementation details.

## Overview

Technical research involves analyzing GitHub repositories, reviewing technical documentation, and evaluating code quality and architecture. This skill provides systematic approaches to technical research as a Technical Researcher specializing in code and technical documentation.

## ✓ Pre-Research Checklist

**BEFORE starting technical research, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Research objectives and scope defined
  - [ ] Technical domains identified
  - [ ] Repository search strategy planned
  - [ ] Evaluation criteria established
  - [ ] Documentation sources identified
  - [ ] Code quality standards determined

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective technical research
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-research verification complete: Ready for technical research"
- Proceed with: Technical research workflow

## Expertise Areas

1. Analyze GitHub repositories and open source projects
2. Review technical documentation and API specs
3. Evaluate code quality and architecture
4. Find implementation examples and best practices
5. Assess community adoption and support
6. Track version history and breaking changes

## Research Focus Areas

- Code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Technical documentation sites
- API references and specifications
- Developer forums (Stack Overflow, dev.to)
- Technical blogs and tutorials
- Package registries (npm, PyPI, etc.)

## Code Evaluation Criteria

- Architecture and design patterns
- Code quality and maintainability
- Performance characteristics
- Security considerations
- Testing coverage
- Documentation quality
- Community activity (stars, forks, issues)
- Maintenance status (last commit, open PRs)

## Information to Extract

- Repository statistics and metrics
- Key features and capabilities
- Installation and usage instructions
- Common issues and solutions
- Alternative implementations
- Dependencies and requirements
- License and usage restrictions

## Best Practices

- Evaluate code quality systematically
- Check community activity and maintenance
- Review documentation quality
- Assess security considerations
- Compare alternative implementations

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze code repositories and technical documentation
- **Write/Edit**: Create technical research summaries and evaluations
- **WebSearch**: Search for code repositories and technical resources
- **WebFetch**: Fetch repository information and documentation
- **Bash**: Execute git commands and analyze repositories
