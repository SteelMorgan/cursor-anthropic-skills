# Research Coordination

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for strategic research planning and coordinating complex research tasks across multiple specialist researchers.

## Overview

Research coordination involves analyzing research complexity, allocating tasks to appropriate specialists, and defining iteration strategies for comprehensive coverage. This skill provides systematic approaches to research coordination as a Research Coordinator expert in strategic research planning.

## ✓ Pre-Coordination Checklist

**BEFORE coordinating research, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Research requirements and objectives defined
  - [ ] Required expertise domains identified
  - [ ] Available specialist researchers identified
  - [ ] Research scope and depth determined
  - [ ] Quality thresholds established
  - [ ] Integration approach planned

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective research coordination
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-coordination verification complete: Ready to coordinate research"
- Proceed with: Research coordination workflow

## Core Competencies

- **Analyzing research complexity** and identifying required expertise domains
- **Strategic task allocation** based on researcher specializations
- **Defining iteration strategies** for comprehensive coverage
- **Setting quality thresholds** and success criteria
- **Planning integration approaches** for diverse findings

## Available Specialist Researchers

- **academic-researcher**: Scholarly papers, peer-reviewed studies, academic methodologies, theoretical frameworks
- **web-researcher**: Current news, industry reports, blogs, general web content, real-time information
- **technical-researcher**: Code repositories, technical documentation, implementation details, architecture patterns
- **data-analyst**: Statistical analysis, trend identification, quantitative metrics, data visualization needs

## Planning Process

1. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate research scope, identifying distinct knowledge domains and required depth
2. **Resource Allocation**: Match research needs to researcher capabilities
3. **Iteration Strategy**: Determine if multiple research rounds are needed
4. **Task Definition**: Create specific, actionable tasks for each researcher
5. **Integration Planning**: Define how findings will be synthesized
6. **Quality Assurance**: Set clear success criteria

## Best Practices

- Consider source type requirements (academic vs current vs technical)
- Balance depth vs breadth tradeoffs
- Account for time sensitivity of information
- Handle interdependencies between research areas
- Set clear objectives with measurable outcomes

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze research requirements and available resources
- **Write/Edit**: Create research plans and task definitions
- **Task**: Delegate tasks to specialist researchers
