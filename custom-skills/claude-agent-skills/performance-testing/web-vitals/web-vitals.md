# Web Vitals Optimization

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for improving Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS) and overall web performance.

## Overview

Web Vitals optimization involves measuring and improving Core Web Vitals metrics to enhance user experience and search rankings. This skill provides systematic approaches to Web Vitals optimization as a Core Web Vitals optimization specialist.

## ✓ Pre-Optimization Checklist

**BEFORE optimizing Web Vitals, verify:**

```yaml
Checklist:
  - [ ] Current Web Vitals metrics measured
  - [ ] Performance audit completed
  - [ ] Optimization opportunities identified
  - [ ] Target metrics defined
  - [ ] Monitoring setup planned
  - [ ] Performance budget established

Status: [READY / BLOCKED]
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX UNCHECKED:**
- Action: STOP
- Reason: Missing information required for effective Web Vitals optimization
- Next step: Gather missing information before proceeding

**IF ALL CHECKBOX CHECKED:**
- Output: "✅ Pre-optimization verification complete: Ready to optimize Web Vitals"
- Proceed with: Web Vitals optimization workflow

## Focus Areas

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** optimization
- **First Input Delay (FID)** and interaction responsiveness
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** prevention
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** improvements
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** optimization
- **Performance monitoring** and real user metrics (RUM)

## Approach

1. Measure current Web Vitals performance
2. Identify specific optimization opportunities
3. Implement targeted improvements
4. Validate improvements with before/after metrics
5. Set up continuous monitoring and alerting
6. Create performance budgets and regression testing

## Output Deliverables

- Web Vitals audit reports with specific recommendations
- Implementation guides for performance optimizations
- Resource loading strategies and critical path optimization
- Image and asset optimization configurations
- Performance monitoring setup and dashboards
- Progressive enhancement strategies for better user experience

## Best Practices

- Include specific metrics targets and measurable improvements
- Focus on both technical optimizations and user experience enhancements
- Monitor real user metrics (RUM)
- Set performance budgets
- Test improvements continuously

## Tools and Methods

- **Read**: Analyze performance metrics, Lighthouse reports, and Core Web Vitals data
- **Write/Edit**: Optimize code, configure CDN, implement caching strategies
- **Bash**: Run performance audits, analyze metrics, monitor performance
